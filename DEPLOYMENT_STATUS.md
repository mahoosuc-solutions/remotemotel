## Architecture Refactor Summary

### What Changed

**From**: Custom room-based system with TODO stubs
**To**: Industry-standard Twilio + OpenAI Realtime API relay pattern

### New Components

1. **Audio Relay** (`packages/voice/relay.py`)
   - Bidirectional WebSocket proxy
   - Real-time audio transcoding (μ-law ↔ PCM16)
   - Sample rate conversion (8kHz ↔ 24kHz)
   - Packet timing and buffering

2. **Hotel Configuration** (`packages/voice/hotel_config.py`)
   - West Bethel Motel specific AI instructions
   - Tool registration (availability, bookings, knowledge base)
   - Voice settings optimized for hospitality

3. **Refactored Gateway** (`packages/voice/gateway.py`)
   - Removed TODO stubs
   - Integrated audio relay
   - Proper WebSocket handling
   - Complete error handling

### Architecture Pattern

```
[Caller] <--PSTN--> [Twilio] <--WS1--> [Audio Relay] <--WS2--> [OpenAI Realtime API]
                                  ▲
                                  │
                           Audio Transcoding
                           μ-law ↔ PCM16
                           8kHz ↔ 24kHz
```

## How It Works Now

### Natural Voice Conversation Flow

1. **Caller dials +1 (207) 220-3501**
   - Twilio receives call
   - POSTs to `/voice/twilio/inbound`
   - Gets TwiML response with WebSocket URL

2. **Twilio opens Media Stream WebSocket**
   - Connects to `/voice/twilio/stream`
   - Sends audio in 20ms chunks (G.711 μ-law, 8kHz)

3. **Gateway creates OpenAI client**
   - Configured with West Bethel Motel instructions
   - Registers hotel tools (check_availability, create_lead, etc.)
   - Connects to OpenAI Realtime API

4. **Bidirectional audio relay starts**
   - **Twilio → OpenAI**: Decode μ-law → Transcode to PCM16 → Resample to 24kHz → Stream
   - **OpenAI → Twilio**: Receive PCM16 → Resample to 8kHz → Transcode to μ-law → Stream

5. **AI handles conversation**
   - Natural speech-to-speech (no separate STT/TTS)
   - Voice Activity Detection (knows when caller stops)
   - Maintains conversation context (stateful session)
   - Can call tools (check availability, etc.)
   - Handles interruptions naturally

6. **Call ends gracefully**
   - Relay stops audio streaming
   - OpenAI client disconnects
   - Session marked complete
   - Statistics logged

## Testing Instructions

### Test the Deployment

**1. Call the Phone Number**
```
Dial: +1 (207) 220-3501
```

**2. What to Expect**
- AI answers with: "Thank you for calling West Bethel Motel..."
- You can speak naturally - no button presses needed
- Ask about: availability, amenities, local area, policies
- AI can check availability and capture booking requests

**3. Example Conversations**

**Availability Check**:
```
You: "Hi, do you have any rooms available next weekend?"
AI: "I'd be happy to help you check availability. Which weekend were you
     interested in? Could you tell me the check-in and check-out dates?"
You: "December 20th to 22nd"
AI: [Uses check_availability tool] "Great news! We do have rooms available..."
```

**Hotel Information**:
```
You: "Are you pet-friendly?"
AI: [Uses search_kb tool] "Yes, we welcome well-behaved pets! There's a
     $20 per pet per night fee. We have designated pet-friendly rooms..."
```

**Local Area**:
```
You: "What's nearby for skiing?"
AI: "You're in luck! Sunday River Ski Resort is just 15 minutes away. It's
     one of Maine's premier ski destinations with excellent terrain..."
```

### Monitor Logs

**Check Cloud Run Logs**:
```bash
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=westbethel-operator" --limit=50 --project=westbethelmotel
```

**Look For**:
- "Stream started for call CA..." - Call connected
- "OpenAI Realtime API connected" - AI ready
- "Starting audio relay" - Audio flowing
- "Twilio→OpenAI: X packets" - Caller audio received
- "OpenAI→Twilio: X packets" - AI audio sent
- "Relay completed" - Call ended normally

---

## Architecture Benefits

### Compared to Previous Implementation

**Simpler**:
- Removed ~80 lines of TODO/stub code
- No custom "room" abstractions
- Clear separation of concerns

**Working**:
- Complete audio relay (was TODO)
- Actual OpenAI integration (was stubbed)
- Real-time conversation (no delays)

**Standard**:
- Follows Twilio + OpenAI 2025 best practices
- Based on official integration guides
- Uses recommended relay pattern

**Scalable**:
- Stateless relay design
- Each call is independent
- Can handle multiple concurrent calls
- OpenAI manages conversation state

**Maintainable**:
- Hotel config in one place
- Audio relay is generic/reusable
- Clear component boundaries
- Comprehensive logging
